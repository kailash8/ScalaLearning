# Scala Access Modifier

Access modifier is used to define accessibility of data and our code to the outside world. 
You can apply accessibly to classes, traits, data members, member methods and constructors etc. 
Scala provides least accessibility to access to all. 
You can apply any access modifier to your code according to your application requirement.

Scala provides only three types of access modifiers, which are given below:

1. No modifier
2. Protected
3. Private

In scala, if you don't mention any access modifier, it is treated as no modifier.
